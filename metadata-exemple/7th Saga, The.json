Update (10\/16\/07): Thanks to the keen eye of gamefaqs poster \u201cusernamehere\u201d, it was noted that even in the original Elnard, magic users\u2019 power did not grow at the proper rate. I have released an alternate patch which, though not exactly true to Elnard, does make playing magic users possible again. Choosing a magic user as a partner should now also be a much more viable option.","patchfile":"patch.zip","patch":["7th_elnard_magicfix.ips","7thpatch.ips"],"screenshot":["1.jpg","2.png"],"id":"264"}},"7th Saga [USA][H.elnard_color_palette-6368].sfc":{"file":"7th Saga, The\/7th Saga [USA][H.elnard_color_palette-6368].sfc","rominfo":{"Internal_ROM_Info":{"File":"7th Saga [USA][H.elnard_color_palette-6368].sfc","Name":"THE 7TH SAGA         ","Company":"Enix","Header":"None","Bank":"HiROM","Interleaved":"None","SRAM":"64 Kb","Type":"Normal + Batt","ROM":"12 Mb","Country":"USA","Video":"NTSC","ROMSpeed":"120ns (FastROM)","Revision":"1.0","Checksum":"Bad 0xFBCE != 0x009E","GameCode":[]},"Hashes":{"CRC32":"CDC49274"}},"romhacker_hack":{"patch_name":"Elnard Color Palette","game_match":{"8D2B8AEA636A2239805C99744BF48C0B4DF8D96E":"7th Saga, The (USA)"},"type":"hacks","url":"https:\/\/www.romhacking.net\/hacks\/6368\/","released_by":"kyuwert","category":"Improvement","patching_information":"No-Header (SNES)","mods":"G","patch_version":"1.0","hack_release_date":"25 November 2021","last_modified":"25 November 2021","desc":"This restores the more subdued color palette from the original Japanese game (Elnard) for all* known graphics that were changed.

There are only two effects of this patch:  M Water now costs only 700 gold instead of 1200 gold (the sell price is also affected) Armor resistances are more evenly distributed across the base\/body armor slot and the accessory slot.  For some reason during localization, all body armor items had their resistances lowered by 20% and all accessories had their resistances increased by 20%. There are a few instances where this isn\u2019t exactly true, such as an item with a 10% resistance being lowered to 0% instead of -10%, because the game does not support negative resistances. Practically, the only noticeable difference in gameplay with this patch (aside from cheaper M Waters) is a slight increase in difficulty for some characters: those that wear heavy armor, as well as Lux and Wilme, will have 10% less Debuff Resistance than they do in vanilla 7th Saga, and Wilme will have 20% less Ice Resistance.

His stats will be subject to a significant bonus that your leader does not recieve, which is an unintentional hold-over from the original Japanese version of the game, Elnard.  The level-up boost for every stat is increased by 1 for levels 10-19, by 2 for levels 20-29, etc.  This means that at level 80 a non-player apprentice should have about 288 extra added to each of his stats! However, while an apprentice is your ally, his stats will rise based on the original boosts listed in the Apprentice Profiles section on future level-ups.\u201d This patch will remove the leftover bonus growth by changing the comparative values to way higher than the max level so they may never be obtained. Providing an even field to main and companion characters while lowering the chances of the player getting stuck with an unwinnable battle by the end game. Even without the bonus, enemy apprentices will still provide a challenge thanks to their doubled MP, 25% defense bonus and debuff immunity.
